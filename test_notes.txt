SENSUM Project - Procedure test

Before any test be sure to have these libraries installed:
- opencv
- numpy
- gdal
- grass

The stack satellite algorithm automatically selects band files in a Landsat folder.

Procedure:
1 - Download the images from GitHub
2 - Change the variable "sat_folder" in order to match the Landsat5 folder
3 - The algorithm is going to loop through the images
4 - Each band image is:
	- clipped using the shapefile ("_city" files)
	- rectified using a reference image ("_city_adj" files) (except the reference one)
	- classified in order to extract the urban area (for the classification it is necessary to define where GRASS is installed in your pc and to 	  create a mapset before executing the algoritm) 
	- pca-analyzed (another method in order to extract the urban area)
	
The library contains functions not used at the moment.
